Removed the following:
	City maps (Google is more efficient)
	Deerowld Golf course
	departments
	NYS links
	Niagara county links
	NT history museum. Website it linked to doesn't exist anymore, resulting in a dead link on the front page of the site
	NT sports. contained highschool sport teams. Deemed unnecessary due to being on ntschools.org

Changed the following:
	Food/restaraunts (google does a better job)
	Entertainment (google does a better job)
	How do i get there? (google does a better job)
	Tour North Tonawanda (links to "ExploreBuffalo.org"'s NT page. Has up to date content and the city won't have to maintain the page)

Questions:
	Would you like a separate page for departments, or is having them lumped in with everything else okay? Possibly have them on both pages?
