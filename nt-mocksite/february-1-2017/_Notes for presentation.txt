made site more efficient with loading times (important in mobile world)
removed unneccessary links and pages (weren't containing information that couldnt be found somewhere else easier)
	-nt history museum. Website it linked to doesn't exist anymore, resulting in a dead link on the front page of the site
	-nt sports. contained highschool sport teams. Deemed unnecessary due to being on ntschools.org
	-many more
changed links for food, entertainment, and directions (google gives accurate results with directions and reviews)
modern design
