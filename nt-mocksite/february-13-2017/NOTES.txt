New Features:
	made site more efficient with loading times (important in mobile world)
	Cleaners and easier to navigate directory
	Modern design

Removed the following:
	City maps (Google is more efficient)
	Deerwood Golf course
	departments
	NYS links
	Niagara county links
	NT history museum. Website it linked to doesn't exist anymore, resulting in a dead link on the front page of the site
	NT sports. contained highschool sport teams. Deemed unnecessary due to being on ntschools.org

Changed the following:
	Food/restaraunts (google does a better job. links to results of food in NT)
	Entertainment (google does a better job. links to results of entertainment in NT)
	How do i get there? (google does a better job. Links to results of google maps directrions to NT)
	Tour North Tonawanda (links to "ExploreBuffalo.org"'s NT page. Has up to date content and the city won't have to maintain the page)
	Historic Pictures (Now links to google image search of "historic pictures North Tonawanda New York")

Questions:
	Would you like a separate page for a departments directory, or is having them lumped in with everything else okay? Possibly have them on both pages?
	Can we remove the "historical pictures" link from the directory?
	Can we remove the "business community" link from the directory?
	Can we remove the "building maintenance" link from the directory?
	Do you want a link to the highschool's website? Isn't completely neccessary, but doesn't create reduncancy
