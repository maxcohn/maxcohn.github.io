	</i></p>
	<p>
	Under the 
	Phase II Stormwater Regulations, the United States Environmental Protection 
	Agency established a municipal stormwater management program to improve our 
	Nations waters by reducing the quantities of pollutants that stormwater picks 
	up and carries into storm sewer systems during a storm event. The City of North 
	Tonawanda has been identified as an owner and operator of a Municipal Separate 
	Storm Sewer System (MS4) and is subject to the Phase II Stormwater Regulations.</p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	The City of 
	North Tonawanda, in partnership with the Western New York Stormwater Coalition (WNYSC), 
	has developed a Stormwater Management Plan
	that is essentially a guidance document to address six minimum control measures 
	that are required under the stormwater regulations. The Stormwater Management 
	Plan includes Best Management Practices for each minimum control measure as well 
	as specific tasks to achieve and maintain compliance. </p>
	<p>
	</p>
	<p>
	The six 
	minimum control measures are as follows:</p>
	<p><i>
	1.  
	Public Education and Outreach on Stormwater Impacts</i></p>
	<p><i>
	2. 
	Public Involvement/Participation</i></p>
	<p><i>
	3.  
	Illicit Discharge Detection &amp; Elimination</i></p>
	<p><i>
	4.  
	Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control</i></p>
	<p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in"><i>
	5.  
	Post-Construction Stormwater Management </i>
	 </p>
	<p><i>
	6.  
	Pollution Prevention/Good Housekeeping for Municipal Operations</i></p>
	<p>
	Portions of 
	the work are provided through the collective efforts of the
	Western New York Stormwater Coalition members. The remaining work is the 
	responsibility of the City of North Tonawanda. For specific information on the 
	City of North Tonawandas Stormwater Management Program, please contact our 
	Stormwater Management Officer, Dale W. Marshall, PE, City Engineer, at (716) 
	695-8565 or

	dalemar@northtonawanda.org</a>.</p>
	


	<p>
	As part of the Phase II Stormwater Regulations, the City is required to report 
	annually on the progress of our stormwater program. Copies of previous annual 
	reports are provided below.</p>

	"Stormwater" <i>What is it? Why is it a Problem??</i></p>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Stormwater is 
		water from rain or melting snow that does not soak into the ground. It flows 
		from rooftops, over paved areas, bare soil, and sloped lawns. As it flows, 
		stormwater runoff collects and transports soil, animal waste, salt, pesticides, 
		fertilizers, oil and grease, debris and other potential pollutants</li>
		<li>Rain and 
		snowmelt wash pollutants from streets, construction sites, and land into storm 
		sewers and ditches. Eventually, the storm sewers and ditches empty the polluted 
		stormwater directly into streams and rivers with no treatment. This is known as 
		stormwater pollution.</li>
		<li>Polluted 
		stormwater runoff can have many adverse effects on plants, fish, animals, and 
		people.</li>
		<li>Sediment can 
		cloud the water and make it difficult or impossible for aquatic plants to grow. 
		Sediment also can destroy aquatic habitats</li>
		<li>Excess 
		nutrients can cause algae blooms. When algae die, they sink to the bottom and 
		decompose in a process that removes oxygen from the water. Fish and other 
		aquatic organisms cant exist in water with low dissolved oxygen levels.</li>
		<li>Bacteria and 
		other pathogens can wash into swimming areas and create health hazards, often 
		making beach closures necessary.</li>
		<li>Debris - 
		plastic bags, six-pack rings, bottles, and cigarette butts - washed into 
		waterways can choke, suffocate, or disable aquatic life such as ducks, fish, 
		turtles, and birds.</li>
		
		
		
		Household 
		wastes such as insecticides, pesticides, paint, solvents, used motor oil, and 
		other auto fluids can poison aquatic life. Land animals and people can become 
		sick or die from eating diseased fish and shellfish or from ingesting polluted 
		water.

	<p><i>
	A partnership 
	to protect water quality</i></p>
	<p>
	A number of 
	communities in Western New York have joined together to develop a stormwater 
	management program to protect our waterways and enhance our quality of life. The 
	goal of the WNYSC is to utilize regional collaboration to identify existing 
	resources and develop programs to reduce the negative impacts of stormwater 
	pollution. The public education and outreach initiatives of the WNYSC strive to 
	enhance public knowledge and awareness of stormwater pollution and provide 
	information to individuals and households to prevent stormwater pollution and 
	protect water quality. To download public education materials or to obtain 
	additional information concerning stormwater pollution prevention,
